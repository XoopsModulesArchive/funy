<h3>Description</h3>
You can create a fairly realistic water simulation in only a few lines of code.
I've seen the algorithm implemented here discussed on many sites. A good
explanation of why this works can be found <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm">here</a>.
The basic approach is:-<br>
<ul>
  <li>Two height maps are used to store the current and previous states of the
    water. You could use int or short data types for these. Each map should be
    the same size as the image or screen area that you are drawing. In my
    implementation I've used a single array of shorts that is large enough to
    cater for both states, plus, I've added two rows per state. Why? That will
    become clear later on.</li>
  <li>Each frame you will toggle between state maps. I'm using a simple offset
    to swap between starting locations within the array.</li>
  <li>For each array element in the current state array:-
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the neighbouring pixels from the previous state, i.e. above,
        below, left and right. Take the sum and divide by 2. Because we are
        dividing by 2 a right-shift will work beautifully.</li>
      <li>Now subtract the value in the current state map.</li>
      <li>If we left it like that the ripples would never subside so we need to
        diminish the strength of the ripple every pass. The most realistic way
        of doing this is to reduce the resulting height by a fraction of itself.
        Once again we can use right-shift to optimise this. In my example below
        I've used reduced the strength of the ripple by 1/32nd of itself each
        time with a right-shift 5.</li>
      <li>We now need to distort a background image based on the height of the
        water ripple in the current location. We do this by calculating an
        offset. Just as with a real pool of water, light rays penetrating the
        water will be refracted. We calculate an X/Y offset based on the current
        distance from the centre of the ripplemap and the magnitude of the
        ripple at this point.</li>
      <li>Perform a bounds check on the offset, i.e. check that the offset
        coordinates are not negative or larger than the size of the texture
        image.</li>
      <li>Plot the pixel at current ripplemap x/y location using the texel at
        the calculated offset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
